                   by anyone visiting the lake.The iconic sites around the lake include Udaipur City Palace, Mohan Mandir, Eklinggarh Fort, 
                   Jag Mandir, Pichola Palace etc. The Sitamata Game Sanctuary is located on its western shore.The sunset view from the boat is truly magical, 
                   as is the changing colors of water from blue in the morning to golden in the noon and orange during sunset.
