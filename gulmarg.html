                <p>  The name “Gulmarg” meaning meadow of flowers truly lives up to its name. The area is filled with excellent views

                    <br><br>
                    How to reach there?<br><br>
                    The small town called Gulmarg is located in the Pin Panjal range of the gargantuan Himalayan mountains in Jammu and Kashmir.
                    The nearest airport to Gulmarg is Srinagar Airport which is well-connected with all the major airports of the country.
                    Gulmarg is around 60 kms from Srinagar by road, which can be reached by self-drive car. However, due to winding high 
                    altitude roads, it takes a long time.
