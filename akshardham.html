                   <h3>Swaminarayan Akshardham came into existence as a result of Shri Yogiji Maharaj’s wish to build a temple complex in Delhi.
                    It was his successor and fifth spiritual guru in line after Bhagwan Swaminarayan, 
                    Pramukh Swami Maharaj who started the construction of the temple.
                     About 60 acres of land was granted by the Delhi Development Authority and 
                    30 acres by the Uttar Pradesh Government for the erection of this temple. 
                    Standing on the banks of River Yamuna, Akshardham Temple was opened to the public on 6th November 2005.</h3>
